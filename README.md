KMeans Clustering on Student Performance Data
This project applies KMeans clustering to a dataset containing student CGPA and IQ scores to identify distinct performance groups. The goal is to visualize how clustering behaves differently on scaled vs. unscaled data.

Key Highlights:
Clustering students based on CGPA and IQ using KMeans.

Comparison of results with standardized (scaled) data vs. raw (unscaled) data.

Demonstration of how unscaled features can distort clustering due to unequal feature magnitudes.

Visualization of predictions for custom test points on both models.

This project reinforces the importance of feature scaling in distance-based machine learning algorithms like KMeans.
